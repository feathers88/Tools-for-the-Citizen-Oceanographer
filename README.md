# Tools for the Citizen Oceanographer

A handy field kit for exploring and understanding your ocean. This list is a community effort. Feel free to add the tools you find indespensible to this list. 

##The Field Kit

1. [Hand Refractometer](http://amzn.to/1MXkxgu) - This simple device uses a prism to determine the salinity of a solution. Place a drop os water on the lens, hold up to the light, and focus. The line between the blue and white fields will correspond to Practical Salinity Units or specific gravity depending on your instrument. 

2. [Sechi Disk](http://amzn.to/1LwdspX) - 

3. [Jeweler's Loupe](http://amzn.to/1MXl7uO) - There are dozens of options for small, hand-held magnifying glasses. Andrew particularly likes this cheap 60X pocket microscope with two differnt illumination settings. 

##Free and Open-source Software

1. [R](www.r-project.org) is one of the most versatile and widely used statstical packages out there. The [`oce` package](http://dankelley.github.io/oce/)* and the `gsw` package (on which `oce` depends for the TEOS-10 equations) are extremely useful. The `ocedata` package contains lots of useful datasets.
